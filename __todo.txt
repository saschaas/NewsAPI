  Better Alternatives to Consider:

  1. Add stealth scripts to Playwright to hide automation signals (inject JavaScript to mask webdriver properties)
  2. Use Firefox or WebKit instead of Chromium (different fingerprint)
  3. Add human-like behavior: mouse movements, random scrolling, keystroke timing
  4. Residential proxies (adds cost but significantly improves success rate)
  5. Check if MarketWatch has an official API for news access (legitimate, sustainable approach)
  6. Try their RSS feeds or alternative endpoints that might be less protected

  My recommendation: Before switching tools, let me try adding stealth JavaScript injection to Playwright first. This is a common technique that masks automation properties and has a good success rate against many anti-bot systems. Would you like me to implement this approach
   instead?
